For this problem, you will be implementing an interactive Dashboard display using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In your project directory, create a new file name as dashboard.js that implements a JavaScript class named Dashboard that can be used as in the following example:

var dashboard = new Dashboard('sidebar','content');
dashboard.render('Home','Account','Message','Support');
The constructor takes an argument consisting of two id attributes for two existing div (sidebar and content).
 The object should have a render method that takes one argument consisting of a list of section names ('Home', 'Account', 'Message', 'Support').
 When render is invoked it replaces the contents of the sidebar's div with HTML that displays a list of buttons with text from the section names.
 It also put a default heading into the content's div with HTML that displays "Welcome to Dashboard!":

Welcome to Dashboard!

When a button on the sidebar is clicked, the "active-btn" class should be added to the clicked button and should be removed from other buttons.
 The content's div should display a heading with the name of the clicked button:

Home
Account
Account
Message
Support.

Once you have created the JavaScript class, I have provided a file index.html 
(you do not need to modify this html file) containing two empty div elements, plus a bit of JavaScript code that
 invokes the Dashboard class to display a sidebar and the content area. The provided html file also has a styling stylesheet 
with the filenameÂ dashboard.css.-->
